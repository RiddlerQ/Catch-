Project I made to refresh my memory after long break from programming.

Catch! is a game I played on arcade when I was little, it's not complex so I thought I will give it a try.

I don't have time right now to debug or write comments for code, just wanted to upload first semi-working version.
I will add bug-fixes, comments and different updates in next days. My goal is to do it next in Python, C# (and javascript maybe?).

This README will be updated too c:
